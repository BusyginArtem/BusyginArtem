### Hi there, welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Artem Busyhin, a Senior Frontend Engineer with over 6 years of professional experience in building modern, scalable web applications. I specialise in React, TypeScript, and Next.js, and Iâ€™m passionate about clean architecture, performance optimisation, and delivering exceptional user experiences.

I began my career as a Fullstack Engineer at Drive Datum, working across the stack to build data-driven tools. Later, I joined SWEET.TV where I led frontend development for a high-traffic streaming platform. As a Senior Frontend Engineer at Uran Company, I helped re-architect and scale large B2B and B2C platforms using React, Redux, and Next.js.

Currently, I work as a freelance Frontend Engineer, collaborating with clients to design and develop feature-rich applications using the latest technologies, including Next.js App Router and server components. I actively focus on DX, component libraries, CI/CD, and Dockerized development.

Beyond client work, Iâ€™m sharpening my skills in AI integration and full-stack development with Python, while earning certifications in React with TypeScript, Next.js 15, and Google Cloud.

Iâ€™m now looking for a Senior Frontend role where I can take ownership, contribute to architecture decisions, and build products that make an impact.
